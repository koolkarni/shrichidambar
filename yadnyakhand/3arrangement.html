<p align=justify>Almost all arrangements were made at the designated place for the Yagya on the banks of river Malaprabha .
In the middle of it there was an Ashwath tree which is still there till today. A big Vedic style pandal or mandapam was erected. A large kitchen was also constructed at a little distance from it. On the southern side the soldiers, labours  etc. were expected to stay. The Brahmins and priests were accommodated on the northern side. In between these, a big madapam or sheet was prepared for Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji . <p>

<p align=justify>Shri Diwakar Dixit came closer to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and told that every thing was arranged but a store keeper was not appointed to keep watch on and to keep the accounts.  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that, keeping the accounts was not their business. It was the rich people’s duty and that should not  do. God has given every thing and we would use it for the       
people. They did not need to maintain accounts. But Shri. Divakar Dixit had different views and he was
not convinced. He thought in mind that large amounts of things were brought there and one must keep watch and details of them. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that if at all he wanted to keep accounts he might put the responsibility on Shri Madiwalappa of Garag village.  Shri. Divakar Dixit confused as he knew that Shri.Madiwalapa was blind.  Diwakar wonder as to how could  that blind man maintain accounts. </p>

<p align=justify>Mean while Shri. Shambhatta Yogshretha arrived there. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  suddenly went to him and hugged each other. The tears  from eyes of the both dropped on ground. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told all about the plan of Somayaga. Then Yogsheshtra Shambhatta told that in order to see such a big yadnya on earth, he had arrived there. Later on Shri Divakar Dixit arranged some other accountant. Thousands of bags of sugar, rice, wheat, ghee and many things had been collected. Mean while Shrouta Brahmins arrived there and requested  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  to come and see the Yagya Mantapam which was arranged  according to Vedashastra. </p>

<p align=justify>Every body arrived there and saw the stones, flags,  toranas, banana trees, mango leaves, sugar-cane sticks etc. some plants and samplings were especially brought and arranged there as per requirements of Vedic science. At the same time one Brahmin with a shining personality and wearing a white cloth arrived there and  entered Yagya Mantapam. Shri.Divakar Dixit was angered and shouted to him and ran to drive him away from there. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji stopped Divakar and apologised to that person who had entered and paid respects to him. Soon the person disappeared. Every body  was surprised at this. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that  he was Yadnyeshwara who had entered and occupied his place well in advance for the next day’s yadnya. Every body prostrated towards the place where he had disappeared.<p>
