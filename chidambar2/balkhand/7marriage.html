<p align=justify>When Chidambara grew up to become a young man of marriageable age, his father 
Sri Martand Dixit thought of getting his son married to a good girl.  He 
discussed his wish with his son Chidambara, who knew that it would be fulfilled within a 
short time. He agreed to his father’s wish. In a few days then, one Mr. Lingopant 
from a village called Madhalli (now Matolli)from Savdatti taluk happened to 
visit Sri Martand Dixit.  In the course of their discussions, Lingopant  informed 
Sri Martand Dixit that he had a daughter, Saraswati, for whom he was seeking a 
good matrimonial alliance.  In fact, while discussing, he wanted to establish a relationship 
with the Dixit family and expressed his wish to fix Saraswati's marriage with 
Chidambara. After receiving the offer, Sri Martand Dixit replied saying that he 
would convey his decision shortly. A few days later, after hearing from 
Chidambara, Sri Martand Dixit expressed his assent to Lingopant for the 
alliance.  The betrothal took place shortly as per Hindu tradition and the 
auspicious date for the marriage was decided.</p>

<p align=justify>Friends and relatives from both the families were invited for the marriage  
which took place at Madolli. This was in the year 1765, (Shake 1697, as per Hindu calendar) that Chidambara’s 
marriage to Saraswati was solemnisd among pompous rejoicement. Even the Gods 
from the heavens appeared disguised as Brahmins in the white dress to witness the marriage. 
The  bridegroom, who came in a palanquin was received by the by the bride’s 
father, Lingopant with offering of “madhupaak”(a sweet). The bride was 
beautifully dressed in an “ashtaputri” ( the ceremonial bridal dress). As the auspicious moment of muharata 
came, all those present in the marriage hall bestowed their blessings on the 
young couple by showering ashtakas (sanctified food grains symbolising prosperity) during the recital of the “mangalashtaka” (wedding song).  
Even the Gods in the heaven, including Brahma and Vishnu, showered flowers and 
ashtakas as it was the marriage of Lord Shiva and Parvati.  The marriage 
ceremony lasted for four days after which every one returned to their homes with 
memories of the happy event. The Dixits also returned home happily with their 
newly-weds. The wedding of the younger son of Sri Martand Dixit, Shri Prabhakar 
took place after some days.</p>

<p align=justify>One day, a family friend of the Sri Martand Dixit who was an astrologer visited 
their house. After dinner, while reading Chidambara’s hand, the palmist 
predicted that he was destined to have a second wife. Sri Martand Dixit had no 
doubt about the palmist as he was a learned person and told Chidambara that 
his predictions never went wrong. But Sri Martand Dixit very well knew that 
Chidambara was no else than Lord Shiva having two wives i.e. Parvati and Ganga. 
The astrologer left the next morning.</p>
<p align=justify>There lived a Brahmin named Manigiri in a village called Shellikeri (now in 
Bagalkot district of Karnataka) who had a wife named Krishnabai.  They had a son 
who was a great devotee of Lord Shiva and was married to Sou Tungabai.  It is 
with the grace of Lord Shankara that they bore a child who was later named 
Bistappa.  Bistappa became an influential person in later years and came to be 
known as Bistangauda (headman Bistappa).
Bistanagauda tied knot with Sakharbai. They had a beautiful daughter named 
Savitri.  When Savitri became a teenager, Bistanagauda 
visited an astrologer to know her future. After reading the horoscope of  Kum 
Savitri, the astrologer assured Bistanagauda that his daughter Savitri would get 
married to Lord Shankara, a divine boon which could be realised only after several 
births.  Bistanagauda felt happy and the astrologer even suggested the name of 
Shri Chidambara.</p> 
<p align=justify>One day, Bistanagauda came to meet Sri Chidambara who knew well,  the reason 
of his visit.  Upon enquiry, Bistanagauda told that he was a devotee of Lord 
Shiva. He also told that he had a beautiful daughter named Savitri.  He said 
that his guru had sent him to meet Chidambara and request him to marry his 
daughter, Savitri.  Sri Chidambara glanced at his father upon hearing  
Bistanagauda’s offer and Sri Martand Dixit who was listening to all the 
conversation gave the nod. Sri Martand Dixit settled rest of the things and the 
marriage took place at Shellekeri.  Sri Chidambara, like Lord Shiva with Parvati 
and Ganga, lived happily.</p>
<p align=justify>Later on, Sou Saraswati gave birth to Shri Diwakar, Shri. Shankar, Shri 
Mrutyunjaya and Shri Bapu while Shri Kashinath, Shri Bhaskar and Kum.Laxmi were 
children of Sou Savitri.  </p>
