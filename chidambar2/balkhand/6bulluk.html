<p align=justify>In a village called Bedsur near Murugod  there lived a disciple of Sri 
Martand Dixit. His name was Mallappa.  Mallappa was a wealthy person and a firm believer in 
God and spiritual activities. He had built a Shiva temple in the village and the 
consecration ceremony, that is Pranapratishtapana, was planned. For that he 
approched Shri Martand Dixit with a request to fix an auspicious day for the said ceremony 
of the temple. Shri Martand Dixit referred the almanac and fixed a day for the 
opening. Shri Mallappa returned back to his village and and began to make 
arrangements for opening ceremony. Accordingly he  invited all the Brahmin 
preachers and priests of the village. But they advised him that  the day was  
inauspicious as there was a Mrutyu Shadashtak yoga on that day.   Mallappa was 
confused and replied that it was the same day given or fixed by his guru Shri 
Martand Dixit. How could it be inauspicious?  The other Brahmins reiterated that 
it was certainly not a good day. As Mallappa had profound faith in his guru Shri 
Martand Dixit,  he commenced ceremony as per his plan without paying any heed to 
the Brahmins. </p>

<p align=justify>No sooner did the ceremony start, one of his best and costliest bullock suddenly 
collapsed on the ground and died. The news  reached Mallappa and he felt very sorry 
to hear it and became very nervous.  Mallappa was very much confused about 
continuing the programme. The other Brahmin priests who were present, said that 
they had already warned him that the day was inauspicious. But since he had not 
heeded to them and kept faith in the guru, he had to face the consequences. They 
insisted that he should stop the ceremony then and there and "wait for some other 
auspicious day", the Brahmins said. Mallappa was more confused. During that 
time little Chidambara had arrived there. Chidambara asked Mallappa about why 
the ceremony was stopped midway? A tearful Mallappa told that one of his most 
valued bullock died due to mrutyushadakshaka yoga. He did not understand how the 
muhoortha (an auspicious moment for the ritual) went wrong as it was recommended by Shri Martand Dixit. Chidambara 
assured Mallappa that if the muhurta had been fixed  by his father,  it would 
never go wrong. It has to be auspicious definitely. Little Chidambara always 
used  to tell “ Shubham bruyat “ meaning always speak auspicious. "Let us see where is the bullock ?" said little Chidambara. They all came to the 
hut where the bullock had laid dead on the ground. Chidambara took water in his hand and sprinkled it on the bullock. To everyone’s utter shock, 
the bullock got up as if awakened from its sleep, wagging its tail. And little 
Chidambara told Mallappa that he was worrying unnecessarily and 
thinking of suspending the ceremony for no reason.</p>

<p align=justify>Chidambara said that the muhurta selected by his father could never be wrong and 
hence the remaining part of the function be resumed. All the brahmins present 
were surprised by this little boy. The ceremony took place in a grand manner. 
Then child Chidambara returned to Murugod. The news of life given to a dead 
bullock by the little master spread far and wide. The news also reached Shri 
Martand Dixit.. Looking at all these miracles, Shri Martand Dixit advised 
Chidambaara not to exhibit his abilities till he was alive or until he told him 
the right time to show. Chidambara agreed to his father’s advice and told him 
that he had only shown him his “Baal Leela” (Child acts).
The day Chidambara put life to the bulluck was the muhoortha of SHUKLAPAKSH 
PANCHAMI  (Thursday). Even today it is known as a Gurudatta yoga. or Gurudatta 
muhoortha.</p>

<p align=justify>Since his childhood Chidambar had an absolute faith in his father. He had profound love
and affection for his parents due to which he kept up his father's advice by bringing back the dead bull
 to life.</p>
