<P align=justify>Once a yogi after his trip to kashi (banaras) returning with a water of Ganga in a kawadi( in ancient time the bags are used to take water with them). He was going  towards Rameshwaram  to pour the same on the Rameshwara as per hindu rituals. On the way one night he dreamt in which he saw Rameshwara who told him that do not go up to Rameshwaram I am in Gurlhosur near Savadatti in the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. You may go to Gurlhosur. In the morning  when the yogi wokeup, he rememberd the dream and enquierd about Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji, some people told him that, yes we have heard, some people told as yes we have seen actual god. Latter on he thought of going to words  Gurlhosur and stared  towards along with his kawadi. </p>

<P align=justify>After  some days he reached Gurlhosur. Then he took darshana of Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. The yogi prayed to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and requested him that I have brought ganga from Banaras ( Kasi) and I have to make bath to Rameshwara and you being the actal Rameshwar  please accept my request and allow me to perform the pooja.  Then Sri chidambar Mahaswamiji told " how it is possible,  I’m a simple man having two wives six children  like a very ordinary person how is it possible that  I’m Rameshwara?". The yogi requested many many times but Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji has not agreed. </p>

<P align=justify>Then the yogi got much angry and told that if at all you have not permitted me to perform  pooja  I will throw all the ganga water with kawadi and suicide myself. Till then Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was testing the yogi. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  smiled a little and told the yogi that do not be angree be cool and come over here and do  what ever worship you like. The yogi  came closer to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told taht I will allow you  but with one condition  that is  " till the end of pooja (bath or abhisheka)  you must  close your eyes ". The yogi also agreed upon likewise with a condition. Then accordingly Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji sat in a big plate.  The yogi brought the kawadi  of ganga water . He got closed his eyes with cloth .  Then the yogi  started his abhisheka, pooja. Soon after first "aavartana" when he touches the body of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji he felt there is no touch of man. It feels  like a Shivalinga. Again he continued abhisheka and again and again he was feeling shivalinga 
insted of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji's body. Then with enthusiasm  cum confusion of his mind which made him to open the cloth on his eyes to see. To his surprise Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  was there in place of the Shivaling. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told him that you have opened your  eyes and the abhisheka, pooja, worship is finished.</p>

<P align=justify>Then  with happy tears the yogi started to chant the stotra of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji . Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji gave him the " brahma updesha ". Since then the yogi was there with Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji only till end of his life.</p>
