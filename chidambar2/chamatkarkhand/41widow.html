<p align=justify>Once Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji was in the area of Galgali (Galav). Its a  very beautiful area on the banks of river Krishna. One day Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji took bath in the holy river Krishna along with the disciples. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was just came out of the water after holy bath. A woman named Narasubai  standing on the banks of the river came forward and prostrated in front of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji , Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji blessed her as astaputra saubhagyavati-bhava ( blessed  to have children). Every body nearby are surprised. The lady also surprised  much, as they know that she is widow.</p>

<p align=justify>Then the villagers of the area who came for the darshana of Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji at the same time told Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji  about her as she is widow. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji said that its gods will and wish which is told by me. </p>

<p align=justify>Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji called one brahmin and told him to perform the pooja of the holy river with the hands of  the lady and every thing will be ok . Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji went from there. Accordingly one of the brahmin started to perform the pooja with the hands of  Narasubai . The brahmin asked her to go and get bath  in to the holy Krishna river and come for the pooja. Narsubai went in to the holy river and dipped, a minute, two minutes gone , one hour lapsed but the lady has not came out of water.  The brahmin and the nearby devotees who saw this have also frightened. Mean while a lady has seen coming out of water. The lady came toword the brahmin for the pooja. They asked her about. The lady repplied that she has gone with the " yakshyas" who were performing the pooja of lord Siva underneith  the water I attended it and returned.  So I was late to come out. Then she finished the pooja of holy river Krishna.To  the surprise of every body a man like a  sanyasi having long beard and mustaches arrived there to the place of pooja. The lady saw him keenly and surprised  to see that he was her husband, who has left his house for teerth yatra long back. And about him  only the news was received that he was dead and since then the lady use to live as a widow. But now she recognized him and welcomed him. Then the person also took holy bath.</p>

<p align=justify>All the people along with the Narsubai and her husband came and prostrated in the lotus feet of Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji. Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji told that its all gods grace. Next year both the lady and her husband arrived to Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji along with a baby named Monam Bhatta and put it on the lotus feet of Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji and prostrated. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji has blessed them to be happy with chanting the name of god. The couple lived a happy life with chanting the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji, Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.</p>
<p align=justify>Narasubai is from the village Yandigari, Joshi family. After Monambhatta the family of his next generation Gangadhar,  Krishna, and presently  Panduranga bhatta are livng there now.</p>
