<p align=justify>Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji use to live at Gurlhosur. People, desciples, devotees do come for the darshana . Each one terurn with satisfaction after Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji darshana.  During the time Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji visited Kashi and Gaya to perform the rituals as per hindu tradition. At the same time Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji use to live at Gurlhosur as well as at Banaras ( Kashi). People and desciple do not understood at all.</p>

<p align=justify>Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji performed all rituals and pooja etc at kaashi with giving the large amount of donations to the archakas, brahmins etc. After  the completion of the same Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked about the dakshina amount to be given to them. Total the biil or dakshina amount was 110000coins. then Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji paid the amount  out of the great "gindi" ( the jug ) in the hand. While paying the same Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji stopped in the middle and asked for the total. It was 1000 coins less to the total told. Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told to stop here only. Also told to the archaka or brahmin that he will pay 1000 coins after reaching Gurlhosur. The brahmin agreed accordingly. At the same time Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji gave him a promisory note also for 1000 coins duly signed. <p>

<p align=justify>After some months when Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was sitting with his sons and desciples at Gurlhosur. On that time a person named Gayawaal arrived there and made namaskara to Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and sat infront of Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Mahaswamiji asked him about. Gayawal said that have you forgotten me, you have lived two months at me in Kashi and performed all rites and poojas and gave donations in lacs to the archakas and brahmins. Also you have kept 1000 coins pending to pay. All the people and relatives surprised and they could not understood anything.  Everybody said that Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was here only and not left the home, then how is it possible. The Gayawal became little angree. And he told that I have got a promisory note duly signed by Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji for an amount. At the same time he tookout the promosory note and showed  infront of Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Shri Diwakar took the same and to his surprise the letter was duly signed by Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji only. Mahaswamiji smiled a little and asked shri Diwakar Dixit to bring 1000 coins as per letter of promise. 
Sri Chidambar Mahaswamiji gave him extra amount for his traveling and also provided good cloths etc and sent him back with respect.</p>

<p align=justify>It shows how one should give respect to the promises made </p>
