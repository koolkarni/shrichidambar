<p align=justify>After leaving Murugod, Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji went to Deulgaon. One day, Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji told one of his disciples to clean the room with cow – dung, put a Mrugajina on it and draw Rangoli on gound. The disciple did the same.</p>

<p align=justify>Meanwhile a sanyasi came to the house. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji reached to him and washed his feet with water, brought him inside with respect, asked him to sit on the krishnajina (skin of a deer, on which rishis practise meditation). The disciples of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji asked about the sanyasi. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji said, “His name is Shri Narayana yati, studied in Kashi (Benaras) and as per order of his guru, he came to Kolhapur where he worshipped goddess Mahalaxmi. Then as per directions from the goddess, he went to Narsobawadi ( A great Datta Kshetra ) where  Lord Dattatreya gave darshan to him and taught every thing he need . Once when we  were in Narsobawadi, he prepared the food with yogagni and served it to us. We are lucky, he is here with us”.  Then Narayanaswami preached the desciples  “Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji is actually Lord Shiva. Chant the name Chidambara, Chidambara. He will give you every thing. The name itself cleans us from all sins. I always chant the name Chidambara, Chidambara. Shri Narayana yati also told that, Once we were on a tour. We took a halt in a Brahmin's house in the night. To the  bad luck, the Brahmin's son expired the same night. Every body was crying.  We took ash. Put it in dead boy’s mouth with chanting of ‘Chidambara, Chidambara’ mantra. And  to the surprise of all ,  The child  woke up. This indicates the name itself has sanjivani”. Which shows the nama mahima also.</p>

<p align=justify>Next day Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji planned to go for parva-snana, on hearing the same Shri Narayana Swami said Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji  “It is winter season. Devotees accompanied will be sick due to cold in night. When every teertha is at your feet, why teerth-snana for you?” Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji agreed upon
and said, “ We will take bath in a well near the village”. Every body went to the well out side the village and 
saw that there was no water in it. Then Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji chanted Ganga-Stavana and immediately a water source started in the well.</p>

<p align=justify>After some time the water level increased,  Shri Narayanaswami, Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji and all devotees took bath. With a happy mood Shri Narayana Swami said, “ This is Bhagirathi and came to the feet of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji with which we are all benefited.” After some days, Shri Narayanswami started for Narsobawadi and 
the tears come out from Shri Narayanswami's eyes. He said, “You are Chidambar as well as Digambara.” Further Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji said, “if you are going to Wadi, on the way in Sangli, one of my devotees called Sakharam Garde is in prison. You give him a massage that on the 16th day from today, he will be released from Jail.” As per 
Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji's advice Shri Narayanswami left for Wadi.</p> 

<p align=justify>Shri Narayanswami met Sakharam Garde in the prison at Sangali town. Sakharam Garde was very happy to listen the massage about his release and more happy with the darshana of Shri Narayanaswami. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji know every thing in advance </p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji had made padya pooja of Shri Narayan Yati indicates the greatness of him to bow infront of saints. In the name of parv-snana he brought gaga water for the people</p>
