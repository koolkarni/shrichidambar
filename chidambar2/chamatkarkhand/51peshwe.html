<p align=justify>After the historic second yadnya (Somayaga ) in Kaliyuga  (the first one  is done in the dwaparayuga by Shri  Yudhistara with the help of lord Shri Krishna ). Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji lived at Navalgund on the request of  his disciples and villagers. The Somayaga  greateness reached  to every corner of the country.  The biggest king of the time the Bajirao Peshwae second of Pune  has arrived to Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji for darshana  along with his ministry and huge military. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji gave all the respect and  suitable treatment, hospitality  particularly many types of food items to the king his people .</p>

<p align=justify>The fallowers of king Pashave and some ministers surprised.  And praised Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji about the arrangemets and treatment. The king Bajirao Pashave himself surprised with all this. And asked Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji how it can be made possible. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told that it is all with the help of people like you,  nothing is mine. The people of Navagund also helped to serve you and  your huge military so please take this mantrakshata  and sriphala so as to continue you as per your next day plan .</p>

<p align=justify>The king Bajirao Pashave wanted to test Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji or even he wanted to defame Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji in his mind. So he requested Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji to allow him to stay one more day and enjoy all the things like yesterday. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told, I am a simple Brahamin who is living on the help of others like you, why you are testing me. Even after you know better it is  much difficult to manage the huge military. But the king has not agreed  and stayed forcefully for the second day. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji have no choice other than to supply food shelter etc, as they were guests of him. On the second day all the arrangements  like as per earlier day  were made with more fine. The food  items  also prepaed very much tasty or test fully made and  supplied to entire military along with ministers and kings with Bajirao. The king Bajirao surprised and he prostrated in front of Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji with a shameful heart.  In total around 85500 people took meals.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told him "Oh king listen carefully that I am giving you mantrakshatas and sriphala which are more holly and more precious for you  as well as for  the country men, after accepting them you only should take them upto your palace or home. Then Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji closed his eyes  with whispering some Mantras gave Sri Phala and Mantrkashata to Bajirao Pashave. The king accepted  but  handed over them to the servant near by standing to Peshwa. To see the situation the eyes of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji become wet,  tears dropped down. These were the drops of patriotism which the king understood lateron <p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told "Oh king you have handed over your  everything to the servant, its not only your bad luck but also of the nation. You have not taken the caution.The king didn’t understood the meaning and returned  to Sondur. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told that the days to come are very difficult  abrahamnya days are waiting.Later on the British rule came into India in a fulsome.</p>

<p align=justify>During the time at Navalgund  the marriage of Shri Mrutyunjaya with Kum Mhalasa the daughter of  Shri Bapu  businessman  at Pune.  And Wararuchi 's marriage with Kum Rama, daughter of Mayaral (Mairal) Naik from Kolhapur was also over .</p>
