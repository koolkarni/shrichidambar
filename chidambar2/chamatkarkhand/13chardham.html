<p align=justify>There are a number of people in the world worship the almighty for differant reasons. Once a poor Brahmin came for darshana of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji thinking in mind to seek help for his yatra (spiritual tour of four dhams). 
Four dhams means Shri Badrinath, Shri Kedarnath, Shri Gangotri, Shri Yamanotri all are in the holy Himalayas.
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked him whether he wished to carry out the four dham yatra. The person surprised on hearing, because since long time he had a wish to travel for the darshana of all dhams. So he said to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji, “I am very poor. I can not carry out the four dham yatra. Only in mind only I can do it, because most of the money is used for the family maintenance.” Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told him to take bath and arrange to make sankalpa (deciede in mind). After arrival Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji gave two coins to him ( in those days the coin was called a Hon) and told that God would arrange and help for the tour i.e. yatra.The person was surprised and verymuch happy with the kindness of Mahaswamiji</p> 

<p align=justify>The Brahmin set on the tour (yatra). Every time when he spent two Hons i.e. coins, two new coins would remain in the bag and like that with the kindness of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji he and his family had darshana of all four dhams and the wish of him was fulfilled. Happily he retuned to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and prostrated to say thanx. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked about how his tour was. He told all about his happy tour.</p>

<p align=justify>Then Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked him about the two coins where they were which he had given to him ? The Brahmin fellow thought that if he said they were with him and if Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked him to return he would be in loss "as the coins never finish". So he told that during the tour he had  spent them at the last stage. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji smiled and said, “Tathastu”. i.e. let it happen as you wish. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told nothing more to him.Then the person returned to his home and searched for the coins in the bag he had kept. He was astonished that the coins were not there where he had kept. He thought and thought very much, felt very sorry, and at last he came to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji . Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji said smiling, “why you are worrying when you spent them and that too the coins are not yours”. When the person prostrated in front of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and teared. The kind hearted Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told him never to lie, always speak the truth. and once again do not do like that. 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji blessed  him and sent to his village. 
With the blessings of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji he got whatever he wanted and he lived happily 
with his family, chanting the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.</p> 

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji is always kind enough to all. He teaches to follow the truth always. </p>
