<p align=justify>Mr.Desai was a village officer  in Murugod under  Tallur  sanstan (Parasgad talooka during shake 1718 it was under Munnolli talook ). Shri Lingopant Kulkarni was his assistant who was from village Zarzaravi (talook Savadatti).Lingopant was a devotee of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji. Mr Desai  was very arrogant and cruel. He was using 
power for his personal benefits. </p>

<p align=justify>Once Lingopant and  Desai had a dispute over the issue of  money. It reached to such an extent that Desai planned to murder his colleague, Lingopant. One day Lingopant was sitting in front of Mahaswami. A peon from Desai came there and told Lingopant that Desai had some work with him and called him to his house. Lingopant asked Shri. 
Chidambara Mahaswamiji for permission to leave. But Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji did not permited and ordered him  not to leave the place. Even then, Lingopant told he would see him and return immediately. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji said, “No,don’t go”. But Lingopant did not listen to Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji and went to Desai's house. </p>

<p align=justify>Soon after reaching Desai’s house, four persons came suddenly with swords  in their hands and beheaded Lingopant. Back here, Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji slowly said, “Shiva! Shiva! I have to leave this village. People present there could not understood  the reason why suddenly in the middle  Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji  is saying like that . Latter on they came to know . According to shastra( tradition), where a Brahmin’s blood is spilt on earth, the earth becomes unholy for brahimns to live. So I have to leave this place”. Then Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji stood up and started to leave Murugod along with his family  to Devalapur. </p>

<p align=justify>As per Vedic sciences, where a Brahmin's blood is spilt on earth or where a brahmin is killed, brahmins should not live in that place  for at least 12 years. </p>

<p align=justify>Later on after the murder of Lingappa Kulkarni, the Desai has planned to murder Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji  at Devalapur . Chief of  Devalapur was Mallasarja who was ruling the area . Mallasarja 's wife sau Rudramma means Tallur Desai's sister. With the help of Mallasarja , Desai was planning . But sau Rudramma was devotee of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji and so she arrived to Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji and told all about . Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji told her " do not worry nothing will happen to me ". Rudramma was returning back to her home. At the same time Mallasarja arrived there  by knowing that the matter is going to disclose and with angreely he took a sword and rushed to words Sau Rudramma to punish her. Rudramma rememberd Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji and immidiatly Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji arrived or seen there . By seeing suddenly the arrival of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji  Mallasarja surprised and frightened and he can not lift his sword and stood as if a statue till Mahaswami called him to come. He came to Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji and prostrated and begged to excuse . Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji had a great heart and excused him. Since then Mallasarja also became a devotee of Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji along with sau Rudramma.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji is a very kind hearted , he use to excused even people like Mallasarja. At the same time Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji has protected Sau Rudramma's husband who was the devotee of him .</p>
