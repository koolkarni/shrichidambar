<p>Shri martand Dixit has became old, he was thinking likewise. With the birth of Chidambar he enjoyed everything of a son. Also Shri Martand dixit thought that being the incarnation of Lord Shiva, his son has stopped manythings for him and it is the correct time to tell him to do his mirracles and lokasangraha for the sake of dharma. Also he thought that it is the correct time to leave. One day accordingly he called Shri Chidambar and told his wish and advised some  family matters.  Next day Shri, Martand Dixit completed all the anusthanas as per his daily schedule and sat in Vajrasana doing pranayama in front of his son Chidambara.</p> 

<p>After some time, he stopped the prana ( breathing ) with help of yoga. It was the day, Jyeshtha Shuddha Navami – Shake 1788 i.e. 1698 A.D. Shri.Chidambara performed all the last rites (sanskaras) of his father in Kengeri, under
 the Ashwath tree. As a part of sanskara, on the third day, i.e. on Jyeshtha Shuddha Ekadashi, when he was collecting asthi (bones)and chita – bhasma, (when a dead body is burnt, it turns into ashes. The ash such formed is 
known as  chita – bhasma), he saw six small " audumbar " plants sprouting under the hot ash. They had grown upto 2 – 3 inches.</p>

<p>Chidambara named them MATU-AUDUMBARA. A small wall was built around trees. Chidambara used
 to worship daily since then. One can see the tree even today in Kengeri. It is known as shang roop Kalpavriksha, as it is believed that it gives any thing, wished by its worshipper.</p>

<p>Shri.Chidambara performed all the sanskaras (last rites) of his father as per vedic tradition and on the 14th day, many brahmins were invited for meal. When meals were ready, one of the disciple, Kashiraja asked Shri. Chidambara 
whether plates could be served for food? But Shri. Chidambara asked to wait. This happened 2-3 times. Meanwhile, 400 more Brahmins have arrived. Kashiraja was worried and  was not understanding the way to manage a lot of 
people with the limited preparation of meals. He told Chidambara that more food would be needed since lot of Brahmins have arrived. Chidambara said, “ Don’t worry. My father was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. He has handedover Annapurna  to me. So the food will be sufficient to everybody. If you wish to see, come with me. I’ll show you.” 
 ( Goddess of food, by the grace of whom, food is always limitless). </p>

<p>They both went to the kitchen. An old lady with Soubhagya- alankar (ornaments depicting her soubhagya) was standing in kitchen supervising and helping the work. On having darshan of Annapurna devi, Kashiraja was 
surprised and satisfied, with no doubts left in his mind, he returned along with Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji.</p>

<p>Everybody was served a good food and more than thousand people dined on that day. Then Chidambara offred donations, dakshina in form of Gold and cloths as per their status as a part of rites.</p>
