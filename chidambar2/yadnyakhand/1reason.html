<p align=justify>It was an era of drought and deteriorating human condition because of the ever increasing sin on the earth during this period 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji took birth to help the poor, needy, good people, animals and plants. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji helped the villagers of 
Muragod by offering free food. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji then went to Navalgund village for nation-wide travel. But the aim was to help the poor and 
needy people in the drought. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji helped the people by moving one place to another, from one village to another and reached 
Navalgund. The people of the Navalagund village became very happy as they knew very well about  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji who was like God and 
would help in the days of drought. They welcomed him very heartily. </p>

<p align=justify>At Navalgund  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji opened a Sanskrit Vedic School, and taught the students there. One day 
Mr.Vishwambharpant Gokhale, one of the friends of Bajirao Peshave of Pune, arrived for the darshana of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and requested 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji that  "I wish to be your disciple and like to live with you for the services here only. Kindly permit me in this regard ".   
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji agreed as he knew that Mr.Gokhale was the kind hearted person and since then Mr.Gokhale was with 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji as a disciple.</p>

<p align=justify>Mr. Gokhale was a kind and compassionate person. He was moved by the sufferings of people and all the living creatures in that area due to
the intense drought. One day he spoke to Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji about the severity of drought over the prolonged period of time and hardship 
being experienced by the people. He prayed to Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji to help them and liberate them from starvation, death and diseases.
 However, Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji informed that rain was dependent upon one's noble acts of charity, that is punykarma. As there was a constant 
growth in the sinful activities of human beings, God has punished them by causing drought. However, Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji offered a solution 
to instigate people's sufferings. He advised Shri. Gokhale to organise a Yadnya or a ritual of lighting a holy fire in an altar and appease the deities or God 
by offering various things for sacrificial rite in it. He asked Mr. Gokhale to get it performed under the aegis of learned priests so as to do away with those 
problems and difficulties faced by the people. Mr. Gokhale said that it was hardly possible to get priests more learned than Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji 
for the task.</p>

<p align=justify>After some time  Shri. Diwakar Dixit arrived there from Gurlhosur and prostrated at the feet of Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji. He enquired 
him about the plight of people. Shri. Diwakar told him that every thing was quite well due to the discourse or sermon on Shri Madbhagawat. It was started 
by a certain devout Brahmin. He also told that it had given the draught affected people a great respite from there carking cares and corroding anxieties. 
Shri. Diwakar informed that on the last day of his sermon, the Brahmin had told the gathering that Dhrmaraja during the Mahabharata era had 
 performed a rajasuya yadnya. ( A ritual of Holy fire at altar), also known as Somayaga to liberate the people from the burdon of their sins and invite the 
rain God to bestow upon people, prosperity and peace. After that no one had ever tried to replicate Dharmaraj'a efforts. By saying this, Diwakar persuaded
 Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji to favour people of his area by performing Somayaga of the scale so the people may get great relief. Diwakar was very lavish
in his praise of Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji and was amused by his innocence. He made it clear that Dharmaraja was able to perform the Somayaga 
because he was blessed by Lord Shrikrishna in his endeavour. However he himself was a simple Brahmin and could not be compared with Dharmaraja and
 that it was hardly possible for human beings to perform such an act. Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji also remarked that in Dwaparyuga (Dwapar era). 
Lord Krishna had performed it on an epic scale, but in Kaliyaga (Present era) it could not be performed. However, Diwakar could do it on a small scale. 
Lord Krishna did it because he is both the creator and the creation itself. He was endowed with divine powers to control the whole universe. But the
 mortal human beings in Kaliyaga would not be able to emulate his example. Even after hearing this piece of advice, Diwakar Dixit was still unconvinced. 
However, Vishwambhar Gohkale and others who accompanied Diwakar opined that if Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji wished and willed it then nothing was
 impossible in the world. He expressed a hope that Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji might agree to their request for the sake of people’s welfare. The people
 gathered there also prayed to Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji to bless them with his consent. Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji moved by their earnest request 
and finally agreed to help them organise the Somayaga.     </p>
