<p align=justify>It was the day of Avabhruta i.e.  the concluding part of the yadnya. On that day early morning Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji along with his wives and children, rutvijas, Brahmins, disciples, devotees, kings, soldiers with elephants, horses, every body newly dressed proceeded towards the river Malaprabha as scheduled. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was walking slowly. He looked like a king who arrived at his capital after winning the battle or as if the earth was arriving from the heaven. The Brahmins, kings, queens, devotees and soldiers of all types holding their flags roared in praise of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Every body was applauding Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Plants and animals also praised him. There were all types of musical instruments being played. The notable dancers of the time were performing their dances. Some exotic flowers were being showered upon the head of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Even gods might have celebrated the success of somayaga in the heaven. As the procession led by Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was moving towards the river Malaprabha, people standing on both sides of road were showering kumkum (vermillion), flowers, turmeric, perfumes, fruits, ashtagandha (fragrant powder) and the specially procured water of the river holy Ganga. A floral carpet was also led on the road, Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji walked along gracefully. He looked at people very affectionately and gave them his blessings. </p>

<p align=justify>The procession reached the banks of the river Malaprabha. People had assembled there to perform the Varun homa (a ritual to appease the rain god). As a part of that Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and his family members entered the stream of holy Malaprabha. he invoked the holy rivers like ganga, yamuna and saraswati to come to him and bless him. As soon as he finished his invocation or prayer to the rivers, the water of the river Malaprabha began to rise. As decided by them, five rounds of cannon were to be fired after which all others were to take a dip into the river. Soon kings, queens, noble man, soldiers and other devotees entered the stream of the river and took a dip. some mantras incantation were chanted and thousands of devotees applauded Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji in their roaring voices. Then as per schedule, a big cannon was fire in the air and suddenly every one took a dip into the river. It seemed as if lakhs of people had disappeared from the river bed. After a few moments Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji came out of the river. He applied the bhasma Lord Shiva. He put on white clothes and white turban symbolising purity of soul and returned to yadnya mantapa. He was flanked by his two wives. It was a very fascinating sight to look at because Shri Chidambar mahaswamiji resembled Lord Shiva accompanied by his two wives, Parvati and Ganga who had descended from Kailash and were walking at Gonnagar. Every one followed.</p>
