<p align=justify>as Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji agreed to participate in the Somayaga, the devotees including Diwakar Dixit and 
Shri Vishwambhar Gokhale were extremely happy. They were quite confident of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji’s divine power and authority on religious and 
spiritual matters. All the devotees began to elaborate arrangements for the auspicious event, that is the Yadnya. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji himself sent 
invitations to all the dignitaries such as Brahmins, Priests, Kings, Queens, and Ritwijas etc. Under the kind guidance of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  and 
the leadership of  Shri. Diwakar Dixit and Gokhale. All the disciples and devotees made arrangements for the yadnya at the place decided by 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. The name of place was Go Nagar or Gonnagar. It is near the present-day Ramdurg or near the town of Badami in Bagalkot 
District. It is situated on the banks of river Malaprabha where there are a number of green trees and ample water needed for the purpose.  </p>

<p align=justify>After completion of all the requisite arrangements Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji fixed an auspicious day to move to Go Nagar. 
Accordingly the agnihotra, that is the ritual of lighting the Holy Fire was performed and then their caravan moved towards their destination. 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji prepared to go on foot accompanied by the people of Navalgund, the Royal family members, that is Kings, Queens, disciples, 
families etc. in their carriages, bullock-carts, and also on their horses, elephants. </p>

Brahmins and astrologers, Vedpathis, rutvijas and all types of peoples started to arrive. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was enquiring of everybody. 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji use to tell that they were the main dignitaries, it was their function which was going on due to their grace only. 
He spoke to them in all humility and requested to make themselves comfortable. He announced that as a humble devotee of God and guests, 
he was at their mercy. Mean while some Shrauta, Shatath Brahmins arrived there.  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked about the well being of them and 
requested them to stay at the place shown to them and asked them to be comfortable and asked to take rest. </p>
