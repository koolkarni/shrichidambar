<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji arrived at Mulagund village from Shirahatti  village after helping the people from drought at Shirahatti. At Mulagund also the position was not good. As  it  is nearer to Shirahatti there was no rain and people were very much in trouble. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji is helping the people every day here also. </p>

<p align=justify>One day a beautiful lady named Ramasani, having a nightingale voice who is doing the work of prostitute arrived to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji for the darshana.  She was a well-known famous pros in the area. She was suffering from leprocy, thinking that Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji may help her to come out of the illness.</p>

<p align=justify>She was thinking  that being a prostitute I had done many, many bad things with the help of  beautiful body and voice. But now  every thing is finished due to such illness. Ramasani was thinking in her mind about Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji  as you are actual god, you are kind hearted, you are like a sea, you can excuse people like me even. Oh Lord shankara  please be murcy to overcome the sin I have gathered knowingly unknowingly. I request in the lotus feet of you  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji either you excuse me or show me the way to end my life. with the thinking she arrived to the gate where Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji sat inside. </p>

<p align=justify>There was a long line for darshana and many people gathered there recognized her, some were looking at her some were surprised and some were angered upon her as why she should come over here at holy place. Mean while Somebody  said " why you have arrived here , not to come over here and not touch any thing  etc ". She returned back .Next day once again she arrived thinking the same as usual and same thing occurred. Once again she returned back. On 4 th day when Ramasani arrived  for the darshana people gathered have quarrelled much with her and told as you have beed ordered not to comeover here why you are trying daily . As the arguments aand shouting heard by Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji,  he enquired about. The disciples told them what has happened. The kind hearted Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji who knew every thing called Ramasani inside. Respectfuly asked her the  reason for the arrival. Ramasani with shameful voice closing her mouth told about her and about the leprocy .</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  is allways kind hearted to eachone. What kind of people they may be. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  excused her and also told her the remedy for her illness ie " to wallow on the banana leaves thrown  after eating their meals by brahmins ". The prasada programme is running every day for all, and you may take three days apportunity of the same for wallowing on them when the same were  removed and thrown.</p>

<p align=justify>Ramasani became  very happy, her eyes were full of  tears. Then Ramasani  immediately  went to the place where the banana leaves after the meals have been thrown outside the village.  As she has very much faith in Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji she just stared to wallow on the  banana leaves thrown. Some enthusiastic people followed her. To the surprise of her and  the people followed her day by day the wounds have been cured. After third day her entire wounds have been cured and her skin became like a golden color. She was looking like beauty of heaven . </p>

<p align=justify>Then Ramasani arrived once again to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and prostrated.  She begged pardon for all the sins she has committed and felt sorry. At the same time praised Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji for the kindness even to the lady like her.  Then Ramasani made a pledge that I will spend my rest of the life for worship of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.   Ramasani since then every day  use to perform SEVA  in the early morning  by singing the holy songs of Gods with her beautiful voice.</p>

<p align=justify>After some days  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji called her. And advised her to  to go to her native and get married and live a life with respecting others. Then Ramasani went to her native chanting the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. After some months one of the rich person in the village got married with Ramasani. Since then she lived a happy life. Also she use to come to Muragod for every year to the festval of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. She  lived  a devotional life and at last she went to the heaven.</p>
