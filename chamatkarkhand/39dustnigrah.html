<p align=justify>These are the quotes from ‘Gita’, where Lord Krishna says to his disciple 
Arjun that whenever the society will deviate from its principles, the Lord himself  will appear 
to protect the society and religion, to abstain it from going the wrong way. In the following 
story from the life of Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji, one can experience the same.</p>

<img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg">

<p align=justify>Once three mathadhipatis ( Heads of their math) came to Hubli along with their 
family and followers. Ratnakar, the prime minister of King of Karvirnagar ( now-a-days, 
it is called Kolhapur) heard about these sages and their wealth. He came to Hubli, not for 
serving the sages but to rob them. He surrounded the city with his soldiers. The sages 
frightened. It was beyond their capacity to face the army. They remembered the kind guru and 
started chanting the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji appeared before them. The sages 
told him about the calamity and requested him to take them out of it. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji said, “Lord 
Shankar is almighty and powerful. His name removes the menace. So you should not be afraid.” 
Soldiers entered into the math roaring loudly. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji faced the army. After seeing 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji, fear was created in the minds of soldiers. They frightened and returned immediately.</p> 

<p align=justify>The soldiers narrated the incidence to their captain, Ratnakar. Then Ratnakar 
himself came in the math. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji said to him, “O Ratnakar! Go to the sages in the math and 
serve them with hospitality. Why did you come to me?” Ratnakar felt ashamed and requested 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji to pardon him. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji said, “if you wish that I should forgive you, make the 
sages feel free. Invite them to your house and serve them.” Ratnakar invited the sages to his 
house, but he did not have a bit devotion towards them in his heart. He kept plundering the 
innocent people.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji sent a message to Ratnakar, “ shedding bad practices is beneficial to 
you or you will be no more.” But the arrogant said, “ who is able to fight with me? Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji 
is only a beggar. He can’t fight with me.”</p>

<img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg">

<p align=justify>A man called Dhondopant Gokhale came for darshan of Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji sent 
him towards the King Bajirao. Dhondopant was appointed there as an army-chief.</p>

<p align=justify>Dhondopant Gokhale came to Kolhapur with his battalion of elephants, horses, 
soldiers with the intention to teach a lesson to Ratnakar. On seeing the foe with army, 
Ratnakar angered. A fierce war erupted between them. In this war,  Dhondopant killed Ratnakar, 
looted all his wealth came to Chidambar Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji for darshan. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji said to him, “stay in 
your place. Don’t forget your duties and religion. Protect the poor and  Brahmins.” Offered him 
a coconut as mahaprasad. But Dhondopant was being chesty. He rejected the offerings from 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji saying he always wished victory only. Finally Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji gave prasad to Bapu, son of 
Dhondopant. Dhondopant, his brother and Bapu, all these returned to their place. As said earlier,
 Dhondopant was being chesty and greedy. He started giving trouble to common people. People 
were always worried. Complaints reached to Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji assured people that he would 
protect them.</p>

<img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg"> <img src ="../images/rdot.jpg">

<p align=justify>A lower caste man from the south came to see Shri Chidambar Mahaswmijiji. His name was Dhondi. 
He stood outside of the math on one foot for three days and nights; wishing to have a glimpse 
of Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji. People praised him and informed Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji about him. Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji said, “he is a 
great devotee, no doubt. But mind well, milk given to snake becomes poison. A neem tree, though 
fed with sweet water can not ripe with sweet fruits. Like that, this person will be troublesome 
to people.” After saying this Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji came out. Dhondi prostrated  before him. The guru 
said, “I know you. Live by principles of religion. Protect the poor. Don’t humiliate Brahmins 
or you will be at loss of your life.” </p>

<p align=justify>By the grace of guru, Dhondi became the chief in Tipu’s army. He fought 
against the Huns and defeated the Huns. Dhondopant Gokhale was in the army of Huns. In a war, 
they both had a combat with each other. Dhondopant was killed by Dhondi. </P>

<p align=justify>Bapu, the son of Dhondopant, attacked Dhondi in order to take revenge. On 
seeing Bapu’s battalion, Dhondi was frightened and ran away. He jumped in the river Krishna 
remembering Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji and reached to other bank of river. Till then Bapu had reached there. 
Bapu pronounced Chidambar’s name loudly. Hearing this, Dhondi was pleased. A furious battle 
took place between the two. Bapu beheaded Dhondi. Dhondi left this world cheering Chidambar’s 
name.</P> 

<p align=justify>Bapu completed last rites of his father and then took Shri Chidambar Mahaswmiji’s darshan.</p>
