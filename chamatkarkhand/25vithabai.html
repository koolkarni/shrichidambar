<p align=justify>A  divottee of  Pndharpur Shri Ramappa Naik and Sau Santubai gave birth to a child in shake 1714(1792 ad).
As they were devotees of Vithala and as they got the daughter with the blessings of Vithala they pur her name as Vithabai.(named Vithabai). Since child hood only  Vithabai  is very much interested towords spiritual activities (adhyatma), god etc. As the parents do worship lord Vithala she also got more interest in him . Days were gone Vithabai become elder  and her parents arranged a marriage, but she had no interest in such routeen life </p>

<p align=justify>One night she ran out of home taking  only a photo of Lord Vithala with her.  At night she lost her way and wandered  much in the jungle chanting the name of Lord  Vithal. She also was not known where to go during  these  hours. Vithala gave Darshana to her and told that I am at Kundagol village, South of India, in the name of  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. You go there and you  will get one more associate like you, do not worry. Then Lord Vithala disappeared. </p>

<p align=justify>Early in the morning she listened the familiar voices she knows,  that is of taal mridunga etc chanting the name of  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji in place of Lord Vithala. Vithabai  rememberd the name  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji told by  Lord Vithala. Accordingly she  rushed towords the voice.  She was so happy to see the Dindi which she knew since childhood.  Vithabai  also took darshana of Shri Rajaram Maharaj who was leading the dindi. Also told  him every thing about Lord Vithala till she reached the dindi. Vithabai  followed the dindi as the same was going to Kundagol .</p>

<p align=justify>All of them reached Kundagol and took darshana of  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. Shri Chidambar mahaswamiji  recognizes her and told that,  do not worry you will get what you desire from  Lord Vithala then Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji put his hand on the head of vithabai  she understood who is  Sri Chidambar MahaSwamiji and who is she.  Since then she also become one of the great disciples of  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. She  has written more than 40000 abhangas on  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. (It is understood that  those abhangas are some where near Kalghatgi of Kolhapur District). Vithabai achieved the place of great saint or one of the great disciple of shri hidambar Mahaswamiji. Vithabai is welknown for her dindi of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. It is told that in one of her visit to Alandi she has asked Dnyaneshwar Mauli that  as both Vithala and  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji both are same why the other part, that is Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji dindi is  not growing. Dnyaneshwar Mauli told her to wait , I my self will do that.</p>

<p align=justify>At last Vitahabai  went to Gokarna( a holy place ) and on the waives of the sea she travelled deep in side the sea and disappeared  it was shake 1790( 1868 AD)</p>
