<br>
After leaving Murugod Mahaswami went to Deulgaon. One day Mahaswami told the disciple to clean the room with GOMAYA and draw Rangawalli and put a Mrugajina on it , the disciple has done like that .Mean while a sanyasi having
saffron cloth arrived in front of the house ,Mahaswami reached to him and his feet with water and with respect brought him to sit on the krishnajina(skin of a dear on which rishis practice meditation). The disciples of Mahasewamiji asked about the sanyasi. Mahaswmi told that His name is Narayana
studied at Kashi(Banaras) and as per order of his guru he came to Kolhapur where he worshipped Shri Mahalaxmi then as per order of Shri Mahalaxmi he went to Narsobawadi where Shri Datta Maharaj gave darshana to him and taught every thing to Narayana. Once when we are at Narsobawadi he has prepared the food with yogagni and served to us .We are lucky he is her with us . Then Narayana-swami
preached the Brahmins ie The Mahaswami Chidambara is actual Shiva chant the name Chidambara ,Chidambara he will give you every thing , the name itself removes all sins . I always chant the name Chidambara ,Chidambara .Once we are on the way to teerth-yatra** at night we
halted at a Brahmin's house for our bad luck the brahmin's son expired at night every body ******  then we took an ash put it with Chidambara mantra in his mouth and the child has woke up , which indicates the name itself have sanjeevani.Next day Mahaswami has planned to go for parva-snana , on hearing the same Narayana Swami told Mahaswami that its winter season at night devotees accompanied will
be troubled due to cold , when every teertha is at your service why teert snana for you? Mahaswami agreed and told that we will take bath in the well near by the village . Every body went to the well out side the village and saw that there is no water in it , Then Mahaswami said the Ganga-Stavana and immidiatly a  water source started in the well . After some time the water level increased and Shri Narayana-swami took bath then Mahaswami took bath then all devotees took bath . With a happy mood Shri Narayana Swami told this is Bhagirathi and came to the feet of Mahaswami with which we all are benefitted.After some days Shri Narayan-Swami started for Narsoba wadi aand the tears come out from Narayan-Swami's eyes  and he told that You only is Chidambara as well as Digambara .Then Mahaswami told him that if you are going to Wadi , on the way at Sangli one of my devotee called Sakharam Garde is at prison , you give a massage to him that From today 16th day he will be released from Jail. As per Mahaswami's advice Shri Narayan-Swami left for Wadi.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 SAKHARAM GARDE*<br>
<br>
Sakharam Garde was one of the most loving devotee of Mahaswamiji. The king of Sangli was kept him at prison for investigation in some other case .Garde felt very sorry as he has done nothing wrong for which such a punishment he has to face , at last he convinced himself and
decided that it is a good chance to worship or to meditate Shri Chidambar Mahaswami . During the time he has been
advised in dream by Mahaswamiji to write abhangas, but he has neither been supplied pen nor paper . Then Garde made a inc of cow dung and water and the wall of prison as paper .He wrote many abhangas ie songs on god and Mahaswamiji.One day garde was writing the abhanga Narayan-Swami arrived there
and told about Mahaswamiji and their massage* ie you will be released on the 16th day . Narayan-Swami advised*him to go for darshana after release and went to Wadi. On the day earlier of the said 16th day Mahaswamiji told to the king of Sangli in his dream that " One of my devotee Nana Garde is at you prison , you
relive him immediately otherwise you will be in trouble" .On the next day morning king followed the instructions in the dream and
ordered to release Sakharam Garde.The officials of the prison came to Garde and told that your enquiry is finished and you are free from today . But Sakharam Garde requested that he wanted to live four more days in side the prison , so that he could get copied the abhangas which he has written on the wall of the prison ,The officials told him to get permission for that ie Rajadnya , and accordingly he told the same
in front of the king ,.The king once again remembered the dream and allowed him to live inside and arranged for the requirements of Garde respectfully .Garde has got the writing materials and within four days he got down the same from the wall .The same is available still  as "SHRI MATCHARITRA" Which is of 2500 sloka or song type
abhangas. .Then he went to Mahaswamiji and lived there only up to the end of his life with making seva of Mahaswamiji.<br>

13 BHENDIWAD DESAI<br>
<br>
Mahaswamiji lived at Deulgaon for one year .Then arrived to Kundagol.Near Hubli ther is a village named Bhendiwad is there . A Desai of Bhendiwad once came for darshana of Mahaswamiji and told about not having a child and requested for blessings . Mahaswamiji blessed him with two shriphalas (coconuts) and told first you will have a female child then a male one. After a year they have a beautiful female child . The days and years have gone the child grown up and reached at
marriageable** age and the parents started to think of her marriage .During the same period a devotee of Mahaswamiji called Ram came for darshana to Kundagol thinking in mind to request Mahaswamiji about marriage  as he is poor nobody was ready for marriage .Mahaswamiji recognized the matter in his mind and asked him "You want to marry?" With shameful face Ram said yes but as I have no money who will give the girl ? Mahaswamiji told him that "you go to the house of Bhendiwad Desai and tell him to arrange the marriage of his daughter with you as this is my
massage. Accordingly Ram went to Bhendiwad and conveyed the massage of Mahaswamiji  . Then the wife of Desai told that " Who is Mahaswami to say like this , it is our personal thing and Mahaswami should not
interfere etc" .Then Ram came to Mahaswamiji and told the story . mahaswamiji told to Ram not to worry you go to Bhendiwad and live there only. Ram has again reached Bhendiwad and lived there only by keeping faith on Mahaswamiji's word. Desai thought that Mahaswami might not know how reach I am , so only he might have sent such a poor person. Then he found a rich groom for his daughter and fixed the marriage . When the time of marriage reached the daughter fell sick .Desai brought many good doctors , mantrikas but nothing is
fruitful. Then Desai asked to a Horoscope reader , who told that it is due to Mahaswami only , and if you want to see your daughter live you must respect the words of Mahaswmiji. Desai's wife was very doorth*** ok we do agree but as she is very much weak we will think after one year . The daughter become good
immediately. And also she began to wonder here and there , after some month Desai family thought now nothing will happen and found another rich bride and
decided the marriage ignoring the assurance given. once again the time of wedding arrived and the bride collapsed on the
ground while on the dais itself. Every thing was collapsed ,the groom was angree on Desai that he has arranged the
marriage with a ill daughter and he will not marry and left the pendol**function hall .The
Brahmins told Desai that it is all due to the angree ness** of Mahaswamiji .Even now you request as per Mahaswamiji you request Ram to marry your daughter . Then Desai went
towards Ram and requested him to accept his daughter , Mahaswamiji gave darshana to Ram and told to
except . Here the daughter woke up with cheer and Desai happily made kanyadana and the new couple started for darshana of Mahaswamiji . After reaching Kundagol they prostrated Mahaswamiji then Mahaswamiji sent a massage to Desai of Bhendiwad to come over Kundagol . After Desai's arrival Mahaswami arranged for a marriage
ceremony of Ram. That was like a big rich person's wedding ceremony by looking such
function Desai has become shameful and he Prostrated* infront of Mahaswami and said I am very much sorry for all I have committed , Mahaswami excused him .With the blessings he returned to Bhendiwad then next year Desai has a male child as per Mahaswamiji's blessing long
back. After some days Desai came for darshana of Mahaswami along with a baby and got blessings to live his future life
happily.<br>

disciples to be ready with early bath and all types of fruit and flowers particularly
TULSI all pooja things because Shri Vinkataramana is coming from Tirupati and we must go to

The PALKHI of Venkatramana arrived .With all respect the arti , pooja are being done . Then the palkhi came to Mahaswamiji's house where the vedokta pooja is done by Mahaswamiji .Then the main poojari of the palkhi gave a white paper to Mahaswamiji and told that " Lord Venkataramana in my dream gave this letter to me to handover it to you at Kundagol with taking the Utsava moorthy in the palkhi" at morning when I woke up the letter was near the utsava moorthy.Mahaswamiji told to poojari to read the letter , But nothing is available to read . So the poojari requested Mahaswami that please read your letter you only.Mahaswami took the letter in his hand with a smile and
immediately the golden letters were shining on white paper to read as " I have to pay interest of Rs125000**to Kubera (God of money) please give me that much amount" .Mahaswami laughed** and said Narayana you are actual husband of Laxmi itself ,how I could help you ? are you not joking with me? any way I request you only to help me in doing so .Then the big festival like
arrangements have been done ie mahanaivedya, brahmana bhojana , Vishnu sahasranama's sahasra patha , bhajana at night etc .After two days the palkhi started for return jurny* as per plan . Mahaswamiji performed the shodashopachara pooja with stavana and put a coin of Rs5/-at the palkhi under the cloth and prostrated .The palkhi went to Tirumalagiri(Tirupati).

33 GREAT NAME<br>
<br>
The King of Navalgund was very much devotional and having faith in the god .But once in a
anger mood he killed a Brahmin .Since then he was very much disturbed for what he has done .He went to all  peethas of Shri Shankarcharya they also could not help him .At last he came to Gurlhosur as a ordinary person and for six months he used to clean the ground in front of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji's house .One day Shivashastri asked the where abouts of him he told all the story .Then Shiv shastri asked him to come with and take prasada along with all. Before entering the hall he asked him to say
ShivChidambar twice and sit for the prasada. Accordingly he did and sat to take prasada , but some people know that he has done wrong thing and for that purpose only even Shankaracharya peetha also BAHISHKARA*** to him . And people got up with out taking the
prasada .During that time Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji arrived there and asked what has happend .The dervotees along with Shiv shastri told every thing to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji . Shiv shastriji told that he has got his pashchatapa*** and I
told him to say ShivChidambara twice and brought him for the prasada .Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told that why twice only once if he told ie
pronounced the name ShivCidambara is sufficient .Then the devotees who got up have sat down for taking the prasada with
chanting the name Shiv Chidmbara.One must think that with a single pronauncation of the name
SHIV CHIDAMBAR the biggest sin like brahmahatya is  vanished , what will happen for more and more chanting the name SHIVACHIDAMBAR.
