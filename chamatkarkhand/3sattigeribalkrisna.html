<p align=justify>Once a person named Balkrishna has started for Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji darshana along with his family members. Their daughter felt ill on the way, so the family has lived in a village named Sattigeri. The illness  has increased  and at last  their daughter has ended  the life. The parents  have cried much  , with sarrowfull heart they finished all rites. They were thinking how this has happened when we are going for the darshana of Mahaswamiji .Then with thinking go and not to go for darshana they came for the darshana of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. They stood in the line of waitng  for the darshana of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji saw them and felt very sorry in the mind and Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji called them in between  to comeover infront. Accordingly the couple came forword  and Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked about them and both of them kept silent by looking on the earth but the tears are started droping. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked them  the reason. The couple  told with sarrowful voice  all about their daughter .</p> 

<p align=justify>Why you are blaming  me you have left your daughter in a paddy field and telling here as dead.Shri Chidambar Mahaswami use to tell “ Shubham bruyat “ Speak always auspicious. The couple told that they have burried it and performed  all rites and then only we  came hare for the darshana. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that was not true you may go there and  bring her . The couple prostrated to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and went to bring the kid . The people listening also followed the couple to see the mirracle. The people arrived to the field near the temple and for  their surprise the child was playing there. After seeing the parents she rushed to the parents . Every body  made a jai ghosha(Praiseing slogan ) of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji there only in a loud voice </p>

<p align=justify>All of them then returned to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and prostrated in the lotus feet. Shri Chidambar Mahaswami use to tell “ Shubham bruyat “ Speak always auspicious.  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji blessed them and the family lived for a weak there with Mahaswamiji and then returned to their village .
