<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji  was known in the entire Mysore  State (the present Karnataka). Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji knows almost 56 languages and speak in them with desciples, devotees, visitors etc. There was a person named Vishwanatha in the city of Kalburgi ie present Gulberga. He use to defame all the time about Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji also he was not tolerating the praising word about Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji if any body says about the greatness of Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji, Vishwanatha always hating . </p>

<p align=justify>Once he was on the way to some other village for his personal work and mean time he was also hungry and so he sat under a tree to take his meal and after that he just became flat for a little  while and unknowingly he got a sleep.
After  that  when he got up and started his way he saw a deep jungle where cruel animals are seen running he was frightened, also crying slowly. At the same time he saw a  Sheford  along with his sheeps and Vishwanatha 
rushed towords him and also told all about. Both were walking in the jungle, meanwhile the sheford showed the people in group walking and told  Vishwanath to join them and now you have no risk if you are in a group.Vishwanath  done likewise and the group was going towards Guruvanapur for the darshana of Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. Vishwanatha has no choice than to continue. At last all of them reached Gurlhosur and took the darshana of Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji . </p>

<p align=justify>When Vishwanatha bowed in front of Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji , Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji told him that once long back your father has thrown a Venkatesha idol towards a tree near by your house  you go and get it and worship the same. Because of that only  you have got  such a life and you are  behaving like this .</p>

<p align=justify>While returning  Vishwanath has supplied a hoarse and he returned to his home and digged out the place near the tree and checked. To his surprise he got a beautiful idol of Lord venkatesha, Vishwanatha took it and cleaned  and made proper pooja etc and since then his entire life has changed. He use to live a happy life and  he became a disciple of Shri Chidambar Maha Swamiji </p>
