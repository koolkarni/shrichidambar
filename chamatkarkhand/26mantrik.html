<p align=justify>Once there was a mantrika ( magician with evil spirits ) who was famous for his bad attitude towards others. He learned to achieve many things with the help of mantras. Even he use to challenge to the gods. At the same time he was very cruel, arrogant to every body . His name was famous for cruelty . So he use to visit big peoples, saint  and challenge them rather make the blackmailing so every body frighten with his name.</p>

<p align=justify>Once he visited Tirupati by seeing welness, richness, fame etc. There he asked lord Venkataramana to give him 6000 gold coins other wise I will steel your "aura ". Then he awaited for three days but got no money or gold coins recieved .</p>

<p align=justify>Then angreely Mantrika started the mantras as per his challenge to steel the" aura " of Lord Venkataramana .  Slowly on the first day itself  eight " auras" have been removed. At night lord Venkataramana came into the dream of the main archaka(preast) of the temple and  told him that  "the mantrika is very bad person who has got  much energy with worshiping the allmighty which he is using for the bad things. It is better to give him 6000 gold coins and  send him from here ". Next day the main archaka or poojari  called upon the Mantrika and gave him 6000 gold coins . With this the Mantrika has become more fre.</p>

<p align=justify>After that the mantrika   arrived to Muragod. As the name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was reached every where he thought to see. After coming to Murugod he had sent his follwers to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and told his wish. As many people amongst the disciples of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji know very well about the Mantrika they were frightened littlebit .But Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told them that do not worry everything will be ok and  you people need not frighten. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji has not cared much. The Mantrika has become more angree . At last the Mantrika arrived to   the meeting hall of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji with all of his disciples and people around him fallowed. The Mantrika has not even  bowed infront of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Not mentained the manners. And directly started to talk with a  challenge to Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. The desciples of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji got up with angree but Sri Chidamber Maha Swamiji told that do not worry every thin will be ok and asked them to keep quiet .</p>

<p align=justify>The Mantrika started to challange Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and started for the mantras to track Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. But there was no effect of the mantras  on Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji. Through out day the mantras have continued but nothing has happened. On the next day when  the mantrika continued the mantras he was not remembering the mantras properly, at the same time he had lost slowly his eye sight. The mantrika frightened, he could not spell the words. He was unable to understand what to do.</p>

<p align=justify>At last the desciples of Mantrika met,  disciples of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and requested for remedy. The desciples of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that, Mahaswamiji is actal god ie Lord Shankara  no body in the universe can challange him. And you better take your Mantrika to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji only and seek remedy with a request. The manrika along with his desciples agreed with no choice. With the help of his disciples the Mantrika arrived to Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji and prostrated. Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji told that it is all because of your bad work you have done and doing bad things to others, perticularly brahamins. You have no place in the heaven.The mantrika cryied, prostrated with a request for excuse infront of  Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji .</p>
    
<p align=justify>By seeing the  repentance (paschatapa)of mantrika Sri Chidamber Maaha Swamiji thought to excuse him. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji is always kind enough. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told him to leave all bad mantras and use them for the welfare of people and the mantrika agreed accordingly . Then Mahaswamiji kept his hand on the head of the mantrika. To the surprise the mantrika got his eye sight  then he put his head on the lotus feet of Sri Chidambar Maha Swamiji and become cool.Then the mantrika told that here after I will behave as per your order only,
 I will never committee the sinful acts and fallow the path of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji all the time.</p>

<p align=justify>The kindness of Shri Chidambar mahaswamiji is always like a true god, always excusing to the people who came to seek  rescue</p>
