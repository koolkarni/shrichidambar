<p align=justify>Once a Telugu Brahmin named Bhattanarayana came for darshana of Chidambar Mahaswamiji. On that time the devotees are just sitting for the prasad ( dinner ). Chidambar Mahaswamiji asked him to take prasada (meal ).  Bhattanarayana also sat for the dinner. The food was made up of Jawar  pieces (in Kannada its called as Nuchcha in Marathi its called Kanhe of jawar) so Bhattanarayana asked for the rice. Unless rice  he was not taking food. The devotees requested him but he was not agreed. Then Chidambar Mahaswamiji told him that we can give you rice at night meals, now it is not proper in a single pankti (table).  If you want rice only you may  take some rice cook your self . Chidambar Mahaswamiji gave him a handful of rice-grain and asked him to cook and eat. </p>

<p align=justify>Then Battanarayana took the rice cooked himself and for his surprise he saw that, the quantity of rice remain as it is even if he removed many times a handful of rice grains. The mind of Bhattanarayana was thinking in different way and he started to cook more and more rice and its different products.latter on he started for a big dinner arrangements daily for the people to attract. And not only that he was saying the people that what is there at Chidambar Mahaswamiji ,only Jawar, I have got a AKSHAYA PATRA what is there at Chidambar Mahaswamiji, I can give you many different items do not go there etc. The news was heard through some devotees up to shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. </p>

<p align=justify>And one day Chidambar Mahaswamiji went to Bhattanarayana's house and standing in the doors of Bhattanarayana  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji said OM BHAWATI...  . With listening to the words,  Bhattanarayana came out of his house towards door and saw that actual Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  is in front of him to ask something. Bhattanarayana  smiled with pride, vanity  and he brought a handful of rice grain and gave it to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. Chidambar Mahaswamiji returned to his home. And here at the house of Bhattanarayana  the rice was out of stock. His AKSHAYA PATRA was finished. He frightened cryied and had repentance (paschatapa). Bhttanarayana was thinking much but no way was found.  At last he came to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and prostrated in front of Chidambar Mahaswamiji to pardon.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri  Chidambar Mahaswamiji told him that you are the cause, for all what has happend, what shall I do ?. Bhttanarayana was crying for his mistake and begged Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji to excuse .Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji is always kind enough. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told that you have uttered the bad words while taking meals to the people who came to you for the meals, you go to  them beg pardon to them, get blessed from them first then come to me. Bhattanarayana has done accordingly and came to Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.Shri  Chidambar Mahaswamiji blessed him and sent to his village. Since then Bhattanarayana was living with chanting athe name of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji and also use to come every year for the festival at Murugod.</p>
