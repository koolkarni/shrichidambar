<p align=justify>That road approached to Kundagol Village. On that time Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji lives there only , so there was very much rush of people there in the village . All these three people were very happy to see Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji. All of them went there for the darshana of Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji and stood in a row .  Rajaram decided  not to take any food until Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji darshana , three days have finished  to come his turn for the darshana . On the 4th day night Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji came in   to his dream and told to leave such bhakti or devotion or told to leave the fast . Simple devotion (bhakti ) is required . Also gave him the sugar having coconut to eat . And told the " tarak mantra " in the right year of Rajaram .
Also told that the allmighty to whom you are in search of is " I "only .</p>

<p align=justify>During that time due to the lightning light of the Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  the eyes of Rajaram were closing all the time .  Then Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji took a simple Brahmin  style and told to come for the darshana in the morning . At the same time Rajaram awakened from the sleep and remembered  the dream. Rajaram  even though he had not took the meal he felt like he has  eaten fullstomach , also he felt that his mind was stable , peaceful  , and calm . Then soon Rajaram fis\nished  his morning duties and started for the darshana of  Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji</p>

<p align=justify>During the time Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji was in a meeting (Sabha ) but in the middle of the meet Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji stopped  up and told that a beloved disciple is coming to me let us see him and walked to words the gate at the same time Rajaram was  near to them.  Rajaram  made the saastang  namaskar (prostrated ) to Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji tooked him and hugged . All the disciples gathered there are surprised to see the happening. Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji told Rajaram to ask whatever  he want then Rajaram told he will ask it in a place where there is body available/present .</p>

<p align=justify>Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji is living there at Kundagol village during athe time. On enquiry, these three people came to know the truth and were very happy.  All of them went there for darshana of Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji and stood in the queue. Rajaram decieded  not to take any food until Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji’s darshana. Three days have passed for his turn to come for darshana. On the fourth night, Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji came in his dream and told to leave such bhaktidevotion), a simple devotion (bhakti) is required and gave him the coconut water with sugar and told the ‘Tarak Mantra’ in the right ear of Rajaram. Also told that the almighty  in search of Rajaram is  Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji only.</p>

<p align=justify>At that time due to lighting stroke, Rajaram closed his eyes. Then Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji took a simple form of a Brahmin and asked him to come for darshana in the morning. Rajaram awakened from the sleep and remembered the dream and felt that even though he had not taken meals, he felt he has eaten. Also he experienced a serene peace and calmness. Soon he went to the place where Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji was. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji was in a sabha with disciples. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji stood up and told that a beloved disciple is coming to him. Let us see and welcome him, and walked towords the gate.  At the same time Rajaram was near to them and prostrated. Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji hugged him. All the disciples who were witnessing the event,  were surprised. </p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambara Mahaswamiji enquired Rajaram "as what he wanted ". Rajaram told he would ask it in a place where nobody is present. Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji took him in a room and asked him to be free from all doubts. He further said, “I know that you are the great disciple,” Rajaram said, “Mahaswamiji, I want nothing. I want devotion only and a permanent place in your feet ”  And Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji showed him  the vishwatmak roop of Lord Shrikrishna, so that all of his confusions should be  removed. With the darshana of Shrikrishna, Rajaram forgot his Self-being. He heard that there is no difference between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The nine dnyanangas i.e. vairagya in kama, indriya nigraha, tolerance of confusion (dwandwas), faith in the words of Guru, ahankara tyaga, dhruda abhyas, satsamagama, wining of prana,, vasanakshaya. After this the words of Guru only help you to attain salvation i.e. dnyana with moksha.</p>

<p align=justify>After this Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji put a hand on his head and put some vibhooti in his mouth. Rajaram got what he wanted or thought of, and then he lived  with Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji only. Latter on, he proved the world by writing 4,91,451 abhangas (devotional songs) on Shri. Chidambara Mahaswamiji which are still at Babhulgaon near Vaijapur (Aurangabad District). He is the Bhakta Shrestha.</p>

<p align=justify>Where ever Shri chidambar Mahaswamiji is there Rajaram also there, like Shri Hanumanta with Shrirama
or you may say Shri Tukaraama with Shri Vitthala. The  greatest disciple on earth.</p>
