<p align=justify>Once Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji planned for the darshana of kuldevata Shri Martand Bhairava also called Mallayya or Shri Mhalasakant of Devara Hippargi. It is situated near Sindagi talooka in Bijapur district. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji arrived along with many devotees, disciples performed pooja abhisheka etc. The celebration was like a navaratra fesival (utsava) and daily thousands of people taking the benefit of prasada at devara Hippargi </p>

<p align=justify>One day the pooja of  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  was jast finished and Shri Divakar Dixit arrived to  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  to seek permission to start meals or prasada as usual. But  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  kept quiet after five-ten minutes once again Shri Divakar Dixit asked for permission and again  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  kept quiet.  Shri Divakar Dixit could not under stood and returned back, as the people were hungry
and the lunch time was over Shri Divakar Dixit started to arrange, serve for the prasada and soon after putng all the items in  plates a big cyclone has started. Every where dust spreadout  the pendol has colapsed  nothing can be seen.  After some times the cyclone stopped  many were wounded  and one brahmin person named Ramayogi  who came from Telugu region  has lost his life as he caught under the big stone during the cyclone. The wife of him was crying loudly  and arrived towords  Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  and told thehappening. Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told   " Shubham Bruyat ''  "Shubham Bruyat" and started towords that place and saw the situation.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji started to chant mritunjay Mantra and showered the holly water from his kalasha on the dead body of Ramayogi. To the surprise of all  Ramayogi opened his eyes. His wife had became excited and loudly she was laughing with happyness and when she got the reality she prostrated in the lotus feet of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji.</p>

<p align=justify>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  told that nothing has happend do not worry go and start for fresh preperation of prasada and arrange to serve as early as possible as it is too late already.</p>

<p align=justify>This telugu pandit Ramayogi has written a famous literature called Manimanjari Bhedini later on .</p>
