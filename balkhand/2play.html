<p align=justify>During his childhood, Chidambara used to play with his friends. Once he built up a 
mud temple for Lord Shiva. After its completion, he installed a stone image inside the temple and invoked the spirit of Lord Shiva. When he 
started performing the holy act of worshipping (pooja), by expressing a mere wishing he got all the 
things needed for his ritual. This surprised his  friends who were witness to that incredible occurrence. after some moments 
he took a large quantity of sand on a big leaf and offered to Lord Shiva it as naivaidyam (sacred food). 
After finishing the holy act of owrshipping Chidambara distributed the 
same sand as prasada (blessed food) to everybody present there. To the surprise of all, the sand was transformed 
into bright and sweet crystals of sugar. It tasted sweeter than usual one. The children who were
 present at the event, narrated that wonderful experience to their parents and other friends 
also.</p>
 
<p align=justify>This news spread throughout Muragod and many people come to see the Child 
Chidambara playing with his friends. Some prostrated from a distance and some 
made namaskara (salute) in their mind. Some just glanced casually. Gradually the 
news reached Shri Martand Dixit. One night when child Chidambar reached home 
after play, Shri Martand Dixit called  Chidambara in his room and sighed " Oh 
Chidambara I request you to not to show your divinity now itself , otherwise you 
will deprieve us of your company. I will tell you the right time to behave as 
per your wish. I know you are Lord incarnate but till the time comes please keep 
quiet and be a good child of good parents". Chidambara 
understood the sensitivity and feelings of his father and responded positively 
and ran away at once. It was as if all the four stages (avasthas) such as jagruti (Conscience), swapna (Dream), 
sushupti and turya in his spiritual voyage towards canonization became self evident before Martanda Dikshit.</p>

<p align=justify>Mean while after the second son Prabhakar, Martand Dixit's wife delivered a daughter and she was named as  
Sheshakka.</p>
