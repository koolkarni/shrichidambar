<p align=justify>Shri Shrinivas Shamarao Katkar born in the year1940. He did his  M A  in Philosophy . He served as a  H O D in Philosophy at D A V  collage , Solapur (retired in 2007 ).  Shri Katkar got initiated in his young age in the Shreevidya-akhand-mahayog by two yogic legends , by His Holyness Shri Sadguru Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati the 68th pontiff  of Kanchi Kamakoti the and Shri Sadguru Mahayogiraj pandit  Shri Ishwarshastri Deekshit from Sangli (Maharashtra). Shri Shrivas Katkar is practicing a unique yogic tradition of Shreevidya-mahayoga. Since 40 years he is doing pravachana at his residance . 
He use to write many things on Shrividyamahayoga , poetic expression to his own  spiritual experiences out of his sadhana and study , and about Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji.
Also condusts  yogic classes . All the time he use to teach the teachings of Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji and Shreevidyamahayoga , achieved such a position of sadguru that people of this area and desciples of him recognize  as Gurudeva .</p>

All  devotees of Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji  also respect him for his achievements not only at Sholapur but also at the neighbouring states.  But Gurudeva (Sri Sir ) with a smile says  "people  just say like that " , no body is greater  than Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji .Of course the supporting part of his wife Sau  Sulakshana  (Gurumata) must be mentioned . Who is well known as gurumata.</p>

<p align=justify>It is much difficult for me to write anything about Shri SadguruShrinivas Katkar , but with out whom this A B C of Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji  is not possible ,with his kind guidence and blessings only I am learning to write alphabetes and showing to you.</p>

<p align=justify>The teachings of Shri Sir attracted many people like me .He treats equaly to all human beings irrespective of cast , religion , sex , color ,age and teaches the same and shows the way of light .  </p>

<p align=justify>Like Shri Chidamabar Mahaswamiji he use to live his life mentaining the family ie grihastashrama with a son and daughter , having simple living and spiritual thinking with behavior .</p>
