<p>Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was very kind enough towards all living beings.
Due to this he has great resspect in everyones heart. So every one think of worshipng 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji with a nearest possible. This wish of each one could not fulfilled. 
The number of such people was more which Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji also knew very well.</p>

<p>Once Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji was asked about this under the leadership of 
Shri Rajaram Maharaj and also requested to show some way to worship as they like irrespective of
 age, sex, religion, race, big or small or as if their family member. 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told that I will definatly fulfill your wishes with taking one more 
birth in incarnation of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji in the name of Shri Pandurang Maharaj 
but you have to wait for that. According to this the second son of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji 
named Shri Diwakar Dixit has a son named Shri Anna Dixit  who was a great devotee of 
Lord Panduranga of Pandharpur along with Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji. One night they had a dream in
 which Lord Panduranga told them that from now onwords you need not come to Pandharpur I 
myself will come to you as a son of you. Then as per the blessings of Lord Panduranga they 
got a child in shake 1795(1873 A.D.) at Bhalki near Bidar in Karnatak State. 
So the child was named as Pandurang. </p>

<p>Incarnation of Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji itself  was Shri Pandurang Maharaj. So  since 
childhood only Pandurang used to do many miracles, surprising things, wonders. 
At the age of 10, he was well known as Pandurang Devaru ( in Kannada "devaru" means God ). 
Since that Shri Pandurang Maharaj used to behave as per wishes of the devotees only.
i.e. every thing he used to do as per instructions cum requests of devotees. He used to live in
 anybody's house, used to eat whatever the devotees offered to him, would sleep where they said
 whoever they may be, also would live all the time in the middle of the devotees. Shri Pandurang
 Maharaj fulfilled all the requests of each one who worship. Shri Pandurang Maharaj 
had never done pooja, archana never gave any pravachana or speach. Never told any philosophy. 
He lived all the time to fulfill the wishes of disciples or devotees. Shri Pandurang Maharaj 
lived many days at the house of Shri Bapu Anna Murkumbi and Sau. Laxmibai Murakumbi which is at 
Shahapur area in Belgaum(Karnatak). Shri Bapu Anna and sau. Laxmibai Murkumbi both were great 
disciples of the great saint Shri. Rajaram Maharaj and Shri. Chidambar Mahaswamiji.</p>

<p>After that with the permission of his father Shri Anna Dixit, he lived with Murkumbhi family 
only with Shri Krishtappa Murkumbi and Shri Mahadeo Murkumbi.
Shri Saamb Maharaj (Sri Hanam Seth) use to fallow him 24 hours as a disciple. Some days 
Shri Pandurang Maharaj lived in the house of Shri Ginde at Saraf galli in Shahapur area of 
present Belgaum. Presently  Shri. Pandurang Ginde is writing a book about Shri Pandurang Maharaj
 in the service of the devotees.</p>
<p>Shri Pandurang maharaj left his body on Magha Vadya Panchami, i.e. ( in 1928 ). 
The body was given mantragni, i.e. holy fire in front of the samadhi place of 
Shri Rajaram Maharaj. Once Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji told to Shri Rajaram Maharaj that he would
 come to meet Rajaram maharaj on Magha vadya panchami and Shri Rajaram Maharaj was waiting. 
Shri Chidambar Mahaswamiji  in the name of Shri Pandurang Maharaj arrived on the day he told. 
Since then the samadhi of both are there only.</p>
